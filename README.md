Meredith Gardner's Github Portfolio
## Description
This repository is a portfolio of my projects from the MIT xPro Professional Certificate in Coding program, May 2022-February 2023. It includes projects from class assignments that show an array of knowledge in JavaScript, CSS, the DOM, asynchronous coding, and other skills. Many of the pages use BootStrap in the design.
## Authors and Acknowledgement 
Thank you to the course instructors, assistant, and my fellow classmates for their help with this class. I appreciated your starter code, tips, and feedback.
## Roadmap
In the future, I hope to add more Bootstrap capabilities and improve my use of CSS grids. I would also like to include links to live demonstrations of projects in addition to the code on GitHub.
